# Task Management System

A task management system that allows users to create tasks, assign them to team members, and track their progress. The list created would be names of individuals utilizing the app, sort by task completed and time taken to complete the task. The system could also provide features such as time tracking, and notifications for the app to showcase creativity for the application. The dependencies for this project could utilize Jprogressbar, java class library Time for simple time tracking (subclasses datetimeformatter,localDate and Date classes) and JavaFX library for playing notification sounds for the file.
